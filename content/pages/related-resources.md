## Security Books

### Recommended Textbooks

There are three recommended textbooks (not required!) for this course. In addition, we have a number of other suggestions collected over previous years.

- Katz, Jonathan, and Yehuda Lindell. *Introduction to Modern Cryptography*. Chapman and Hall / CRC, 2007. ISBN: 9781584885511. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "138376e0-4640-4eec-9c8c-233de867aab9" "Google Books" %}}\]
- Ferguson, Niels, Bruce Schneier, and Tadayoshi Kohno. *Cryptography Engineering: Design Principles and Practical Applications*. Wiley, 2010. ISBN: 9780470474242.
- Paar, Christof, and Jan Pelzl. {{% resource_link "52c5fb96-77bb-4e01-b5f7-ef316d57108c" "*Understanding Cryptography: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners*" %}}. Springer, 2011. ISBN: 9783642041006. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "434f8464-2f6a-45c8-8d3d-d697b13984ce" "Google Books" %}}\]

### Other Suggested Textbooks

- Stamp, Mark. *Information Security: Principles and Practice*. John Wiley & Sons, 2011. ISBN: 9780470626399. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "ef56e0f5-96e4-4d9b-80df-bb1d07bcf365" "Google Books" %}}\]
- Menezes, Alfred, Paul van Oorschot, and Scott Vanstone. *Handbook of Applied Cryptography*. CRC Press, 1996. ISBN: 9780849385230. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "b2681d06-b9d2-43ce-ab4d-228d630839d8" "Google Books" %}}\]   
    This is a very comprehensive book. The best part is that you can {{% resource_link "ef4de3e6-e22c-42df-b8dc-b5e1b2dbea6d" "download this book online" %}}! The hardcopy is very convenient though.
- Schneier, Bruce. {{% resource_link "b3cbfb3c-81f7-4beb-9862-7147b644cb99" "*Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C*." %}} 2nd ed. John Wiley & Sons, 1996. ISBN: 9780471117094.   
    This is the best book to read for an introduction to applied security and cryptography. There is much less math than the book by Menezes et al. Sometimes statements are made without much justification, but no other book even compares to this comprehensive introduction to cryptography. The bibliography alone is worth buying the book.
- Paar, Christof, and Jan Pelzl. {{% resource_link "52c5fb96-77bb-4e01-b5f7-ef316d57108c" "*Understanding Cryptography\_*: A Textbook for Students and Practitioners\_" %}}. Springer, 2011. ISBN: 9783642041006. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "434f8464-2f6a-45c8-8d3d-d697b13984ce" "Google Books" %}}\]
- Anderson, Ross. {{% resource_link "a0d40f3f-8e73-40e9-b2b4-7c81650f0926" "*Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems*" %}}. John Wiley & Sons, 2001. ISBN: 9780471389224.   
    An excellent book on security in real world systems.
- Stinson, Douglas. *Cryptography: Theory and Practice*. Chapman and Hall / CRC, 2005. ISBN: 9781584885085. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "455c5937-6a86-4ebf-b9b9-4edc63c29717" "Google Books" %}}\]   
    This used to be required for 6.875, the theory of cryptography class at MIT.
- Schneier, Bruce. {{% resource_link "16fc8af4-ca4e-4554-899e-41a6fda9ae9d" "*Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World*" %}}. John Wiley & Sons, 2004. ISBN: 9780471253112. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "1ef4ab7b-1c52-4a4c-b45a-0bafc53bdf67" "Google Books" %}}\]   
    Schneier used to advocate good cryptography as the solution to security problems. He has since changed his mind. Now he talks about risk management and cost-benefit analysis.
- Rescorla, Eric. {{% resource_link "b21fb14e-e104-445b-96ec-45f80bf5814b" "*SSL and TLS: Designing and Building Secure Systems*" %}}. Addison-Wesley, 2001.   
    The only book you need to read to learn about the evolution, politics, and bugs in the development of SSL. Eric's a swell guy too; buy his book.
- Neumann, Peter. {{% resource_link "af16b623-803f-451f-a67e-561907e5f204" "*Computer Related Risks*" %}}. Addison-Wesley Professional, 1994. ISBN: 9780201558050. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "64e12a5d-f260-47da-8413-f6f2a9074058" "Google Books" %}}\]   
    Power grid failures. Train collisions. Primary and backup power lines blowing up simultaneously. These events aren't supposed to happen! Neumann offers a plethora of stories about the risks and consequences of technology, gathered from his {{% resource_link "b4a8cd54-0590-41cf-b30e-d088678bee0c" "Risks mailing list" %}}. On a side note, Neumann is also responsible for coming up with the pun/name "Unix."
- Nielsen, Jakob. {{% resource_link "f844f0ed-aca2-4b98-915c-30353f311c30" "*Usability Engineering*" %}}. Morgan Kaufmann, 1993. ISBN: 9780125184069. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "d3a0d8ce-2860-43de-a34b-7e26f67ec280" "Google Books" %}}\]   
    There are a lot of non-intuitive GUIs out there for security products. Anyone making a security product for use by humans should learn about the principles of smart GUIs.
- Kaufman, Charlie, Radia Perlman, and Mike Speciner. {{% resource_link "547095ba-af6d-41e5-83c1-b32d9695fce8" "*Network Security: Private Communication in a Public World*" %}}. 2nd ed. Prentice Hall, 2002. ISBN: 9780130460196. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "0cfeff58-730e-4ae0-812c-25a92e578ab8" "Google Books" %}}\]   
    The authors discuss network security from a very applied approach. There is a lot of discussion about real systems, all the way down to the IETF RFCs and the on-the-wire bit representations. The authors also have a fun, informal style.
- Garfinkel, Simson, and Gene Spafford. {{% resource_link "c9a3d3c8-6770-4945-b2e4-4d659c6d0834" "*Web Security, Privacy & Commerce*" %}}. O'Reilly Media, 2001. ISBN: 9780596000455. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "e60e75f1-85bf-4874-9272-9b526d856f36" "Google Books" %}}\]   
    It's hard to keep up with all the security software out there. But these authors do a good job documenting it all. Garfinkel was an undergraduate and PhD student at MIT.

    Chapters 3–10 provide relevant number theory for the class.
